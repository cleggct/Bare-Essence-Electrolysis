# Bare-Essence-Electrolysis
Site for Bare Essence Electrolysis.

This repository hosts all the files for the website. I've set it up
as a static site, so there is no need to run any sort of build
command or anything like that; the files are ready to go as-is.

Just include a link to this repository when setting up a domain
through a web host/provider.

Here is a link with instructions for how to do this through Amazon's AWS:
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/host-static-website/

Since the files are here on github already, you can skip straight
to the section titled "Deploy your app with AWS Amplify".
